- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your version**.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies.
- [ ] type `npm run server` to start the API.

## Project Reuirements

A client has hired you to build an API for managing zoos and the animals kept at each zoo. The API will be used for zoos in the United States of America, no need to worry about addresses in other countries

For the zoos, the client wants to keep track of:

- [ ] Name
- [ ] Address

For the animals, the client wants to keep track of:

- [ ] Name
- [ ] Species
- [ ] List of all the zoos where they have resided

Determine the database necessary to track this information. Label any relationships between tables.
